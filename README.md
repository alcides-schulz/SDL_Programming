# SDL_Programming

SDL Programming

This is a project I'm using to learn windows graphics programming using C++ and the SDL library (https://www.libsdl.org/).

My goal is to code some algorithms using SDL.

I created a header file (SDL_Framework.h) so I can reuse in those projects. This framework is based on javidx9 "One lone coder" youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA).
